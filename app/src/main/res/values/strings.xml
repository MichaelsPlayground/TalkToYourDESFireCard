    1) The app will create a new application with applicationID 010000 and ISO application name D2760000850101,
    this is necessary for NDEF workflow. The app will have 5 AES based application keys. There are no restrictions on file and directory handling.\n
    2) In the new application a new Standard File is created with a size of 32 bytes that holds the NDEF Container File.\n
    The file number is 01 and the ISO fileId is E103h, the Communication mode is Plain,
    Access rights: Read &amp; Write key: E, CAR key: E, Read key: E, Write key: E (E means free access without any authentication)\n
    3) A second Standard File is created in the application with a sie of 256 bytes that hold the template URL for the NDEF Link record.\n
